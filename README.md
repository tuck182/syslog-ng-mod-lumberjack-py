# syslog-ng-mod-lumberjack-py

This project provides a syslog-ng module for use as a destination to write log messages to a running logstash server using the [lumberjack protocol](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) and the syslog-ng-mod-python feature. It is adapted from the example ruby client code in the [logstash-forwarder](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder) project.
